Graduation Admission Acceptance Prediction Using PCA, KPCA and logistic regression
In this paper, we classify and extract the
admission data of 400 students using principle component
analysis By using this model, every student can predict their
chances of acceptance by providing key factors. Before the
classification task, important features can be extracted from the
data set using principle component analysis. In this way, modelâ€™s
complexity can be reduced and accuracy will be increased in some
cases.
Many students apply for the universities around the world
with hope of getting acceptance from them. Determining
which student is accepted and which is not is a difficult task,
and besides it usually takes a lot of time and effort[2]. As a
result, in this paper we consider a data from the acceptance
list of previous student and investigate their situation. This
dataset was built with the purpose of helping students in
shortlisting universities with their profiles. The predicted
output gives them a fair idea about their chances for a
particular university. Classification methods can be
adopted for the chance of admittance in the university. One
of these classification techniques, which we are going to use
in this work, is logistic regression[3].
Increase in the number of variables in a classification
problem leads to increase in the model complexity and the
time needed for computation. Besides, insignificant
variables can even decrease the model accuracy. Therefore,
in this work we are going to use principle component
analysis (PCA) and Kernel PCA(KPCA) to extract the most
important features, before using the classification model.
The rest of this paper is organized as follows: In section 2,
the data which is used in this work is presented. In section 3
and 4, 5 PCA, KPCA and logistic regression are described
and the results of implementations are provided. Finally in
section 6, we conclude our work
